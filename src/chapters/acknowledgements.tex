We would like to express our gratitude to  professor Manuel Mazzara, who kindly agreed to be our academic supervisor, and whose
help and support were virtually invaluable during the course of our work.

Additional thanks go to professor Nikolay Shilov for his useful advices and examination of the original topic proposal.
